Ducks with powers --> what is best way to architect?

Options:
* Inheritance 
    - doesn't work because you end up with too many classes
* Store as attributes
    - doesn't support changing requirements
        - add new Ducks
        - add new powers
        - add new outfits
        - what happens when an outfit doesn't apply to a duck?
        - what if a duck is in two bands?

---> Open-Closed Principle
* objects need to be open for extension, closed for modification

How have we previously encapsulated STATE and BEHAVIOR
--> used classes

SOLUTION: WRAPPER CLASSES 

* Decorator pattern

Composite vs Decorator
* composite: uses composition to represent "part-whole" relationships
* decorateor: uses composition to add an additional state of BEHAVIOR

Strategy vs Decorator
* Strategy is used to encapsulate a behvaior (function or algorithm) 
    so that it can be interchanged at runtime. A behavioral pattern
* Decorator is ussed to encapsualte state and behavior which can be added at runtime.
    A structural pattern.
